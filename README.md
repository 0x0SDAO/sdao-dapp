# [ScholarDAO Frontend](https://dapp.scholardao.net/)

This is the front-end repo for ScholarDAO.

## ðŸ”§ Setting up Local Development

Required:

- [Node v14](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ScholarDAO/sdao-dapp.git
$ cd sdao-dapp

# set up your environment variables
# read the comments in the .env files for what is required/optional
$ cp .env.example .env

# fill in your own values in .env, then =>
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!
Open the source code and start editing!

If you would like to run the frontend in a Docker image (e.g. to isolate dependencies and the nodejs version), run `yarn docker-start`.

## Architecture/Layout

The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container.

The files/folder structure are a **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx       // Main app page

â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/      // Helper methods to use in the app
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        // Shared reactHooks
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/       // Style sheets for dark vs light theme
â””â”€â”€ views/        // Individual Views
```

## Theme Support

Themes are available, but it can be difficult to access the theme's colors.

Material UI components, such as `Button`, can use the current theme's color scheme through the `color` property. For example:

```JSX
 <Button variant="contained" color="primary" className="cause-give-button">
  Give Yield
 </Button>
```

If you wish to use a theme's color scheme manually, follow these steps:

1. Import `useTheme`: `import { useTheme } from "@material-ui/core/styles";`
1. Instantiate the theme: `const theme = useTheme();`
1. Add a style property to the component, for example:

```JSX
 <Grid item className="cause-category" style={{ backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default }}>
 {category}
 </Grid>
```

For the available theme properties, take a look at the themes in `src/themes`.

### Continuous deployment

Commits to the follow branches are automatically deployed to their respective URLs.
| Branch | URL |
| --- | --- |
| master | <https://dapp.scholardao.net> |
| deploy | <https://staging.scholardao.net> |

**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch.

### Feature Flags

- Give: by default it is disabled. It can be enabled by setting the `REACT_APP_GIVE_ENABLED` environment variable to "true", or appending `give_enabled` as a URL parameter.
